# RGBgame
Are you a nerd looking for a better way to pass your time? Then look no further than this RGB game! This game gives you the 3 basic colors 
in the format RGB - Red Green Blue, followed by parentheses - (), and 3 numbers inside it - (#,#,#). The numbers each range from 0 to
255. Your job is to guess the resultant color from the random combinations given. If you're into color scheming as much as I am, you will
absolutely love this game!
